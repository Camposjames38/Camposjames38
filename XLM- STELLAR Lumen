Hi, I made a transfer from my coinbase wallet to coinbase account. I did not place the MEMO code and wasn't too sure if it would make a big difference. The transfer did not go through and is still on my Coinbase wallet but it's not added to my account balance. I really need help getting this to my wallet or coinbase account.
